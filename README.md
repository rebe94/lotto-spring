# Overview

**Lotto Game** project was created in order to help me develop skills to become `Java Backend Developer`.

â€‹	Two applications collaborate to manage ticket receiving and number generating. The applications are built on `modular architecture` with one entrypoint for every module which is `Facade design pattern`.

# Tech stack

- Backend: `Java 17`, `SpringBoot` - `Web`, `Data`, `Test`, NoSQL Database - `MongoDB`, `JUnit`, `Mockito`, `Wiremock`, `Lombok`
- Simple Frontend: `Thymeleaf`
- Deploying: `Docker`, `MongoDB Atlas`, `Heroku`
